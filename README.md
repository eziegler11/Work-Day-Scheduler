# Work Day Scheduler - Jquery

Built with jQuery + DayJS: Displays a daily calendar based on user's timezone.

## Description

I was inspired to make this application as a way to more easily track the day-to-day tasks that people encounter at work. I'm a big believer in staying organized and using this scheduler as a visual tool to see one's day with a quick glance. The color coding of the hour blocks cooresponds with the user's local time zone, so they can track where they are throughout the day.
I learned a lot about jQuery by working through this project. For being my first full jQuery web app, it was really my first time putting jQuery together all on one page.
My biggest challenge was targeting the correct parent div, based on the key that was stored in local storage.

## Installation

Fork my code through GitHub and you can get started just by using the HTML, CSS files and the JavaScript file.

## Usage
